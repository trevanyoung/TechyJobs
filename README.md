## What is this project and what does it do?
TechyJobs is ASP.NET web application built using C#. The data is managed via a SQL server running on Azure. I built this particular application with the goal of helping programmers track their job search by storing jobs they have applied to and recruiters that are speaking with bundled in a friendly mobile package. 

## Application Use Instructions

You will now be able to add, view, update, and then delete jobs or recruiters
